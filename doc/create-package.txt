== Start package without upstream git repo ==
# TODO, we want upstream to be the first branch, etc


== Start package with upstream git repo ==

# clone newly created repo from git.fsinf.at
git clone git@git.fsinf.at/apt/package.git

# add 'upstream' remote:
git remote add upstream <upstream-url>
git fetch upstream
git branch upstream upstream/master

# now we have upstream branch and no master branch, "git branch"
# will show that there is only an "upstream" branch, where you are NOT
# in.

# We now create a local debian/ dir
mkdir debian
touch debian/rules
# ...
git add debian
git commit debian -m "add first version of debian dir"
# as soon as we commit, we have a "master" branch that we are on
# automatically

# we can now merge the upstream branch into the master branch:
git merge upstream

# finally, we can pull everything into the package dir on git.fsinf.at:
git push origin master
git push origin upstream

TODO: fetch upstream sources?
